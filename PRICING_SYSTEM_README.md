# Centralized Pricing System Documentation

## 📋 Overview
This website now uses a **centralized pricing system** to ensure 100% consistency across all pages. All package content, descriptions, features, and pricing are managed from a single source: `js/pricing.js`.

## 🎯 Benefits
- ✅ **Eliminates content drift** between pages
- ✅ **One location to update** all package information
- ✅ **Scales easily** to 28+ service pages
- ✅ **Maintains consistency** across entire website
- ✅ **Reduces maintenance time** dramatically

## 📁 System Structure

### Core Files:
- **`js/pricing.js`** - Central pricing data and functions
- **`includes/footer.html`** - Standardized footer template
- **All HTML pages** - Now include pricing.js for consistency

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Homepage Packages (`PACKAGES` object)
```javascript
const PACKAGES = {
  package1: {
    name: "Get Found Online Package",
    price: "$599",
    features: [/* array of features */],
    // ... all package data
  }
}
```

### 2. Web Design Service Page Packages (`WEB_DESIGN_PACKAGES` object)
```javascript
const WEB_DESIGN_PACKAGES = {
  package1: {
    name: "Get Found Online Package", 
    price: "$2,997",
    features: [/* different features for web design */],
    // ... service-specific data
  }
}
```

### 3. Auto-Update Function
The system automatically updates pricing content when pages load:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', updatePricingContent);
```

## 📝 Making Updates

### To Update Package Content:
1. Open `js/pricing.js`
2. Find the relevant package object (`PACKAGES` or `WEB_DESIGN_PACKAGES`)
3. Update the content in ONE location
4. Changes automatically reflect across ALL pages

### Example - Updating Package 1 Price:
```javascript
// OLD
package1: {
  name: "Get Found Online Package",
  price: "$599",
  // ...
}

// NEW  
package1: {
  name: "Get Found Online Package", 
  price: "$699", // ← Update here, reflects everywhere
  // ...
}
```
